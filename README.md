# MNIST_GAN
A reimplementation of the original GAN on the MNIST dataset (Hand-written numbers from 0-9)

<p>The goal of this neural network is to take in random noise and reconstruct the figure to create a hand-written number. This is the result after 10,000  iterations. The GAN successfully recreated the numbers as can be seen below.</p>
